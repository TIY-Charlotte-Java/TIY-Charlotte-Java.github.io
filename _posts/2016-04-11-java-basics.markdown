## Java Basics

### Goal  
Java was written for portability and speed-to-market. Portability means that Java applications are designed to work on a multitude of devices, and speed-to-market is a relative measure of how quickly a Java application can be developed with respect to the other languages available. These two traits have made Java a very attractive offering over the years, and are a major reason why the Java language has thrived over the course of the past approximately 21 years.

An added benefit to the long-term success of the Java language is the progressive development of a very efficient JVM. There is very little overhead from a Memory and CPU perspective when running a Java application, and it has definite speed advantages over many of the interpreted language offerings.

### Compilation
In programming and computer science lingo, compilation is the process of turning a program from a human-readable language into a machine-readable language (typically not human readable). Compiled version of programs are typically much faster and smaller than what can be created by humans.

Java is a human-readable programming language that is compiled into a low-level assembly language that is readable by a program called the JVM. The JVM is an application maintained by the Oracle Corporation. The following diagram describes the process of the development of the Java language.

All code that humans write in Java will be executed on JVMs that are running on target devices. This slight layer of abstraction provides a separation between the human-readable Java code and the target device. This separation is what gives Java its unprecedented level of portability.

### Usage
The Java language designers (led by architect James Gosling) were successful in their endeavor to create a well-rounded, easy to write, portable language. As a result, Java has reached a near-ubiquitous level in the world. If you use a DVD or Blu-Ray player, an Android device, an ATM or credit-card machine, you have more than likely used a device running Java in the past 24 hours.
